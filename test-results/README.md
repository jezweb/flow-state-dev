# Test Results Documentation

This directory contains documented test results for Flow State Dev testing scenarios. Each test result is stored as a markdown file that can be browsed to understand what was tested and the outcomes.

## Using Test Results

### Browse by Category
Navigate to specific directories to find tests related to particular areas of functionality.

### Search All Results
Use the `INDEX.md` file to search across all test results by:
- Test name or description
- Date range
- Status (pass/fail/issues)
- Components tested

### Quick Access
Recent and important test results are linked directly from this README.

## Contributing Test Results

When documenting new test results:

1. Use the appropriate category directory
2. Follow the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-test-description.md`
3. Use the test result template (see template files in each directory)
4. Update the INDEX.md file with the new test entry
5. Link related issues or pull requests

## Test Result Format

Each test result file follows a consistent structure:
- **Test Information**: Date, tester, version tested
- **Test Scenario**: What was being tested and why
- **Test Steps**: Detailed steps taken during testing
- **Results**: Outcomes, successes, and any issues found
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or output samples
- **Follow-up**: Actions taken or needed based on results

This documentation system helps track testing progress and provides historical context for debugging and improvement efforts.
