# ADR-001: Use Vue 3 with Composition API

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to choose a frontend framework for building our web application. The framework should be:
- Modern and actively maintained
- Have good developer experience
- Support TypeScript
- Have a strong ecosystem
- Be suitable for both small and large applications
- Have good performance characteristics

## Decision

We will use Vue 3 with the Composition API as our frontend framework.

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: React
- **Pros:**
  - Largest ecosystem and community
  - Most job opportunities
  - Extensive third-party libraries
  - Good TypeScript support
- **Cons:**
  - Steeper learning curve
  - More boilerplate code
  - Need to make many architectural decisions
  - JSX syntax divisive

### Option 2: Vue 3 (Chosen)
- **Pros:**
  - Excellent developer experience
  - Progressive framework - can adopt gradually
  - Composition API provides better TypeScript support
  - Single File Components are intuitive
  - Smaller bundle sizes
  - Official router and state management
- **Cons:**
  - Smaller ecosystem than React
  - Less job market demand
  - Fewer UI component libraries

### Option 3: Svelte/SvelteKit
- **Pros:**
  - Compile-time optimizations
  - No virtual DOM overhead
  - Very small bundle sizes
  - Simple syntax
- **Cons:**
  - Smaller ecosystem
  - Less mature
  - Fewer developers available
  - Less enterprise adoption

### Option 4: Angular
- **Pros:**
  - Full framework with everything included
  - Excellent TypeScript support
  - Good for large enterprise apps
  - Strong conventions
- **Cons:**
  - Steep learning curve
  - Verbose and complex
  - Larger bundle sizes
  - Overkill for smaller apps

## Consequences

### Positive
- Developers can be productive quickly
- Template syntax is familiar to those with HTML background
- Composition API enables better code reuse
- Excellent official documentation
- Vue DevTools provide great debugging experience
- Gradual migration path from Vue 2 if needed

### Negative
- Team needs to learn Vue-specific concepts
- Fewer Vue developers in job market
- Some popular React libraries don't have Vue equivalents
- Less community content compared to React

### Neutral
- We'll use Pinia for state management (official recommendation)
- We'll use Vue Router for routing
- We'll need to establish our own patterns for larger features

## Implementation

1. Use Vue 3 with `<script setup>` syntax
2. Adopt Composition API for all new components
3. Use TypeScript for better type safety
4. Follow official Vue style guide
5. Use Vite as build tool (recommended by Vue team)
