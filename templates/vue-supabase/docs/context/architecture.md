# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

<!-- Describe the high-level architecture of your application -->

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with Vue 3 using the Composition API pattern:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/       # Reusable UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ composables/      # Shared logic using Composition API
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ views/           # Page-level components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stores/          # Pinia state management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/        # API and external service integrations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ router/          # Vue Router configuration
```

### Backend Architecture

Supabase provides the backend infrastructure:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with multiple providers
- **Storage**: File storage with access policies
- **Real-time**: WebSocket subscriptions for live updates

### Data Flow

```
User Action ‚Üí Vue Component ‚Üí Pinia Store ‚Üí Supabase Service ‚Üí Database
                    ‚Üì                              ‚Üì
              Update UI ‚Üê ‚Üê ‚Üê ‚Üê ‚Üê ‚Üê ‚Üê ‚Üê ‚Üê Real-time Update
```

## Key Design Decisions

### State Management
We use Pinia for state management because:
- Better TypeScript support than Vuex
- Simpler API with Composition API style
- Built-in devtools support
- Modular by design

### Component Structure
- **Atomic Design**: Components are organized by complexity
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Props Down, Events Up**: Data flow is unidirectional

### API Design
- All API calls go through service modules
- Services handle error states consistently
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Automatic retry logic for failed requests

## Security Architecture

### Frontend Security
- No sensitive data in frontend code
- Environment variables for configuration
- Input validation before sending to backend
- XSS protection through Vue's template system

### Backend Security (Supabase)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- JWT tokens for authentication
- API rate limiting
- Secure file upload policies

### Data Security
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- HTTPS for all communications
- Regular security audits
- GDPR compliance considerations

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Performance
- Lazy loading for routes
- Component code splitting
- Image optimization
- Virtual scrolling for large lists

### Backend Performance
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient RLS policies
- Connection pooling
- Caching strategies

## Scalability

The architecture supports scaling through:
- **Horizontal scaling**: Stateless frontend can be deployed to CDN
- **Database scaling**: Supabase handles database scaling
- **Caching**: Edge caching for static assets
- **Real-time scaling**: WebSocket connections managed by Supabase

## Integration Points

### Third-party Services
- **Authentication**: Social auth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- **Payments**: [Payment provider] integration
- **Email**: Transactional email service
- **Analytics**: Privacy-focused analytics

### API Integrations
- RESTful API design
- GraphQL endpoint (if applicable)
- Webhook support for external events
- API versioning strategy

## Deployment Architecture

```
[CDN] ‚Üí [Static Frontend] ‚Üí [Supabase]
                               ‚Üì
                        [PostgreSQL DB]
```

### Environments
- **Development**: Local development with Supabase CLI
- **Staging**: Preview deployments for testing
- **Production**: Production deployment with monitoring

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Error Tracking**: Sentry or similar
- **Performance Monitoring**: Web vitals tracking
- **Logging**: Structured logging approach
- **Alerts**: Critical error notifications

## Future Architecture Considerations

<!-- Document planned architectural changes -->

1. **Microservices**: Potential service extraction
2. **Caching Layer**: Redis for performance
3. **Search**: Elasticsearch integration
4. **Queue System**: Background job processing
