# Technical Debt Register

## Overview

This document tracks known technical debt, temporary solutions, and areas needing improvement. It helps prioritize refactoring efforts and prevents knowledge loss about why certain decisions were made.

## Debt Categories

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Address ASAP)
*Security issues, major performance problems, or blocking features*

#### 1. [Example] Hard-coded API Keys
- **Location**: `src/config/api.js`
- **Issue**: API keys are hard-coded, security risk
- **Impact**: High - Security vulnerability
- **Proposed Solution**: Move to environment variables
- **Effort**: Small (2-4 hours)
- **Added**: 2024-01-15
- **Owner**: Unassigned

### ðŸŸ¡ Important (Address Soon)
*Performance issues, maintenance problems, or limiting scalability*

#### 1. [Example] No Caching Strategy
- **Location**: `src/services/api/`
- **Issue**: API calls have no caching, causing unnecessary requests
- **Impact**: Medium - Performance and costs
- **Proposed Solution**: Implement Redis caching layer
- **Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)
- **Added**: 2024-01-20
- **Owner**: Backend Team

#### 2. [Example] Component Prop Drilling
- **Location**: `src/components/Dashboard/`
- **Issue**: Props passed through 4+ levels
- **Impact**: Medium - Maintainability
- **Proposed Solution**: Use Pinia store or provide/inject
- **Effort**: Medium (1-2 days)
- **Added**: 2024-01-22
- **Owner**: Frontend Team

### ðŸŸ¢ Nice to Have (Address When Possible)
*Code quality, developer experience, or minor optimizations*

#### 1. [Example] Inconsistent Error Handling
- **Location**: Throughout codebase
- **Issue**: Different error handling patterns used
- **Impact**: Low - Developer experience
- **Proposed Solution**: Create error handling composable
- **Effort**: Small (4-6 hours)
- **Added**: 2024-01-25
- **Owner**: Unassigned

## Technical Debt by Area

### Frontend
- [ ] Migrate remaining Options API components to Composition API
- [ ] Update to latest Vuetify version (breaking changes)
- [ ] Implement proper loading states globally
- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries

### Backend (Supabase)
- [ ] Optimize RLS policies for performance
- [ ] Add database indexes for common queries
- [ ] Implement proper database migrations strategy
- [ ] Add database backup automation

### Testing
- [ ] Increase test coverage from 45% to 80%
- [ ] Add E2E tests for critical paths
- [ ] Implement visual regression testing
- [ ] Add performance testing suite

### DevOps
- [ ] Implement proper CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add staging environment
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployments
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting

### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation is incomplete
- [ ] Missing architecture diagrams
- [ ] Onboarding guide needs update
- [ ] No troubleshooting guide

## Code Smells

### Duplicated Code
```javascript
// Found in 5+ components
const formatDate = (date) => {
  // Same implementation repeated
}
// TODO: Extract to utils/date.js
```

### Large Components
- `UserDashboard.vue` - 800+ lines
- `AdminPanel.vue` - 600+ lines
- Need to break into smaller components

### Magic Numbers
```javascript
// Found throughout
if (items.length > 50) { // What's special about 50?
  // ...
}
// TODO: Extract to constants
```

## Performance Debt

### Bundle Size
- Current: 450KB (gzipped)
- Target: < 250KB
- Issues:
  - Importing entire Vuetify
  - Large dependencies included
  - No tree shaking configured

### Load Time
- Current: 4.2s average
- Target: < 2s
- Issues:
  - No lazy loading
  - Large images unoptimized
  - No CDN usage

## Security Debt

### Authentication
- [ ] Implement refresh token rotation
- [ ] Add 2FA support
- [ ] Implement session management
- [ ] Add brute force protection

### Data Protection
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Implement field-level encryption
- [ ] Add audit logging
- [ ] Implement data retention policies

## Dependency Debt

### Outdated Packages
```json
{
  "vue": "^3.3.0",  // Latest: 3.4.0
  "vuetify": "^3.3.0",  // Latest: 3.4.0
  "vite": "^4.0.0",  // Latest: 5.0.0
}
```

### Deprecated Dependencies
- `package-xyz` - No longer maintained
- `old-utility` - Security vulnerabilities

## Migration Debt

### Vue 2 â†’ Vue 3
- âœ… Core migration complete
- [ ] Update all third-party components
- [ ] Remove compatibility shims
- [ ] Update to script setup syntax

### Planned Migrations
- [ ] JavaScript â†’ TypeScript
- [ ] REST â†’ GraphQL (selected endpoints)
- [ ] Local state â†’ Global state management

## Quick Wins

*Low effort, high impact improvements*

1. **Enable gzip compression** - 1 hour, 30% bandwidth reduction
2. **Add database indexes** - 2 hours, 50% query speed improvement
3. **Implement lazy loading** - 4 hours, 40% faster initial load
4. **Extract common utilities** - 4 hours, better maintainability

## Debt Payment Strategy

### Priority Order
1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Performance bottlenecks
3. Major maintenance issues
4. Developer experience
5. Code quality

### Time Allocation
- 20% of sprint capacity for debt reduction
- One "debt sprint" per quarter
- Opportunistic refactoring during feature work

## Tracking Metrics

- **Debt Ratio**: Technical debt tasks vs feature tasks
- **Code Quality**: Linting scores, test coverage
- **Performance**: Load times, bundle size
- **Security**: Vulnerability scan results
