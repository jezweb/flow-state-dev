## Work Style & Preferences
- **Approach**: Rapid prototyping and iteration
- **Philosophy**: Ship early, iterate based on feedback
- **MVP First**: Build minimal viable product quickly
- **Validation**: User testing over extensive planning
- **Code Style**: Pragmatic, refactor when patterns emerge
- **Documentation**: README and inline comments only

### Development Flow
- Quick proof of concepts
- Iterate based on user feedback
- Refactor when patterns stabilize
- Add tests for stable features
- Performance optimization when needed
- Security hardening before production

### Decision Making
- Bias towards action
- Quick experiments over long debates
- Data-driven iterations
- User feedback drives priorities
- Technical debt tracked but not blocking
