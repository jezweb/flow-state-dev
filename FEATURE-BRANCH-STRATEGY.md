## Branching Workflow

### Feature Development
```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/gui-polish-error-handling

# Work on feature
# ... make changes ...

# Regular commits with conventional format
git add .
git commit -m "feat(ui): add error boundary component"

# Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/gui-polish-error-handling
```

### Task Development (Optional)
```bash
# Create task branch from feature branch
git checkout feature/gui-polish-error-handling
git checkout -b task/error-boundaries

# Work on specific task
# ... make changes ...

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat(error-handling): implement global error boundary"
git push -u origin task/error-boundaries

# Merge back to feature branch via PR
# ... create PR: task/error-boundaries â†’ feature/gui-polish-error-handling
```

## Commit Message Convention

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning (white-space, formatting)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvement
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Scopes (for this epic)
- **ui**: User interface components
- **api**: API integration and services
- **performance**: Performance optimizations
- **testing**: Test-related changes
- **error-handling**: Error boundaries and handling
- **validation**: Form and input validation
- **accessibility**: Accessibility improvements

### Examples
```bash
git commit -m "feat(ui): add loading skeleton components"
git commit -m "feat(error-handling): implement component error boundaries"
git commit -m "test(ui): add unit tests for CreateProject component"
git commit -m "perf(api): implement response caching layer"
git commit -m "fix(accessibility): improve keyboard navigation"
```

## Pull Request Workflow

### PR Creation Process

#### 1. Draft PR (Early Feedback)
```bash
# Push work-in-progress
git push origin feature/gui-polish-error-handling

# Create draft PR for early feedback
gh pr create --draft \
  --title "[WIP] Feature 1: Error Handling & UX Polish" \
  --body "Early implementation for feedback. See #XXX for details."
```

#### 2. Ready for Review PR
```bash
# Mark as ready for review
gh pr ready

# Update PR title and description
gh pr edit --title "[FEATURE] Error Handling & UX Polish" \
  --body "$(cat .github/pull_request_template.md)"
```

### Merge Method
**Squash and Merge** - Preferred for feature branches
- Creates clean history
- Preserves feature branch work in squash commit
- Easier to revert if needed

```bash
# Example squash commit message
feat(ui): implement error handling and UX polish

- Add global and component error boundaries
- Implement loading states and skeleton screens  
- Add form validation with real-time feedback
- Create success notification system
- Improve keyboard navigation and accessibility

Closes #XXX (Feature 1: Error Handling & UX Polish)
```

## Branch Management

### Branch Lifecycle
1. **Create** feature branch from main
2. **Develop** with regular commits
3. **Push** for backup and collaboration
4. **PR** when ready for review
5. **Review** and iterate based on feedback
6. **Merge** when approved and complete
7. **Delete** feature branch after merge

### Branch Protection Rules
- **main** branch protection:
  - Require PR reviews (minimum 1)
  - Require status checks to pass
  - Require branches to be up to date
  - Restrict pushes to main
  - Include administrators in restrictions

### Cleanup Process
```bash
# After successful merge, clean up branches
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/gui-polish-error-handling
git push origin --delete feature/gui-polish-error-handling
```

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process
1. **Start**: Create feature branch and draft PR
2. **Develop**: Implement tasks with regular commits
3. **Test**: Add tests and ensure quality
4. **Review**: Request early feedback via draft PR
5. **Iterate**: Address feedback and continue development
6. **Complete**: Mark PR ready for final review
7. **Merge**: Squash and merge when approved

### Multi-Feature Coordination
- Features can be developed in parallel
- Regular rebasing against main to stay current
- Cross-feature dependencies managed through issues
- Integration testing before final merges

## Quality Gates

### Before Merge
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Test coverage maintained/improved
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Accessibility standards met
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] Documentation updated

### After Merge
- [ ] Feature deployed and tested
- [ ] Metrics monitored for regressions
- [ ] User feedback collected
- [ ] Issues updated and closed
- [ ] Sprint progress updated
