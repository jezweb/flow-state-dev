### Infrastructure
12. [#50 - Command Infrastructure and Documentation](https://github.com/jezweb/flow-state-dev/issues/50)
    - Core setup, templates, and documentation

## Command Organization

### By Thinking Level
- **Level 1 (Quick)**: Direct execution, no analysis
- **Level 2 (Contextual)**: Analyzes context before acting
- **Level 3 (Extended)**: Deep thinking and planning

### By Workflow Type
- **Understanding**: Navigate and comprehend codebase
- **Building**: Create new features efficiently
- **Fixing**: Debug and resolve issues
- **Testing**: Ensure quality and coverage
- **Documenting**: Maintain clear documentation
- **Researching**: Make informed decisions
- **Managing**: Track progress and collaborate

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Week 1) - Foundation
- Command infrastructure (#50)
- Quick action commands (#39)
- Basic documentation

### Phase 2 (Week 2) - Core Workflows
- Feature development workflow (#44)
- Bug fixing workflow (#43)
- Supabase commands (#46)

### Phase 3 (Week 3) - Enhanced Capabilities
- Extended thinking commands (#41)
- Testing workflow (#45)
- Research commands (#48)

### Phase 4 (Week 4) - Polish
- Documentation workflow (#47)
- Workflow management (#49)
- User guide and tutorials

## Key Benefits

1. **Reduced Context Switching**: Stay in your editor for most tasks
2. **Consistent Workflows**: Standardized approaches to common tasks
3. **Better Claude Integration**: Claude understands your project state
4. **Improved Productivity**: Quick access to common operations
5. **Knowledge Preservation**: Decisions and research are documented
6. **Team Collaboration**: Shared workflows and standards

## Success Metrics

- Time saved on common tasks
- Reduction in context switches
- Improved code quality metrics
- Better test coverage
- More consistent documentation
- Faster onboarding for new developers

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize issues
2. Start with infrastructure setup
3. Implement high-priority commands
4. Create video tutorials
5. Gather user feedback
6. Iterate based on usage
