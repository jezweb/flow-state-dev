I've created a comprehensive summary of our entire discussion! This captures:

## 📋 **What's Included:**

1. **Every major topic** we discussed in order
2. **Key decisions and innovations** we came up with
3. **All the templates and systems** we designed
4. **Your specific concern** about overwhelm and the solution
5. **Next steps and future topics** to explore

## 💡 **How to Use This:**

When you start a new chat, you can:
1. Share this summary with Claude
2. Say "I want to continue from [specific section]"
3. Reference any of the artifact IDs listed at the bottom

## 🎯 **The Most Important Parts:**

- **Your Stack**: Vue 3 + Vuetify + Supabase + Flowise
- **Your Goal**: Reduce friction between human and AI coding
- **Your Plan**: Start with GitHub labels (15 min), then build gradually
- **Your Next Step**: Create `my-labels.txt` file

## 📝 **Anything Missing?**

Is there anything else from our discussion you want me to add to this summary? Any specific insights or "aha moments" that should be captured?

This summary should let you pick up exactly where we left off, whether that's tomorrow or months from now. Save it somewhere safe - maybe even as a GitHub gist or in your templates folder!
