# Flow State Dev

## Where Human and AI Development Flows

---

## What is Flow State Dev?

Flow State Dev (FSD) is a comprehensive development system that creates optimal conditions for human developers and AI coding assistants to work together seamlessly. Just as athletes and artists speak of being "in the zone" or achieving "flow state," Flow State Dev brings that same effortless productivity to software development.

## The Problem We Solve

Modern developers face a unique challenge: powerful AI coding assistants are available, but the friction between human and AI workflows often breaks concentration and slows progress. Common frustrations include:

- AI assistants asking repetitive questions about project structure
- Inconsistent coding patterns across projects
- Time wasted on project setup and configuration
- Human tasks mixed with automated tasks causing confusion
- Lost context when switching between projects
- The same errors appearing repeatedly

## Our Solution

Flow State Dev provides a complete framework of tools, templates, and workflows that:

- **Standardizes** project structures so AI assistants immediately understand your codebase
- **Automates** repetitive setup tasks so you can start coding faster
- **Documents** patterns and decisions where both humans and AI can reference them
- **Tracks** human-in-the-loop tasks separately from automated work
- **Maintains** consistent quality across all projects

## Core Principles

### 1. **Zero Friction Setup**
Every new project starts with the same excellent foundation. No decisions about folder structure, no hunting for configuration files, no remembering "how did I do this last time?"

### 2. **Human-AI Harmony**
Clear separation between tasks that need human intelligence (API keys, business decisions) and tasks that can be automated. Both types are tracked and managed efficiently.

### 3. **Living Documentation**
Project knowledge lives where developers work - in code comments, GitHub issues, and structured markdown files. Not in some external wiki that gets outdated.

### 4. **Progressive Enhancement**
Start simple with basic templates and labels. Add automation and tooling only when you feel the pain. Your system grows with your needs.

### 5. **Opinionated but Flexible**
Strong defaults based on best practices, but every choice can be customized for your specific needs.

## What's Included

### Phase 1: Foundation (Available Now)
- **GitHub Label System** - Standardized labels for all projects
- **Project Templates** - Claude.md and structure templates
- **Issue Templates** - For bugs, features, and human tasks
- **Basic Documentation** - README and setup patterns

### Phase 2: Automation (Coming Soon)
- **Project Initializer** - One command to create a perfect project
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated issue management and tracking
- **Component Generators** - Consistent code generation
- **Health Checks** - Ensure project quality

### Phase 3: Intelligence (Future)
- **Smart Error Detection** - Learn from past mistakes
- **AI Context Management** - Optimal information for AI assistants
- **Performance Monitoring** - Track development velocity
- **Custom Workflows** - Tailored to your team

## Who Is This For?

Flow State Dev is designed for:

- **Solo developers** who want to move faster and make fewer mistakes
- **AI-forward teams** embracing AI coding assistants
- **Agencies** building multiple projects with consistent quality
- **Product managers** with technical skills who build prototypes
- **Anyone** who wants to spend less time configuring and more time creating

## The Flow State Experience

Imagine starting your day:

1. Open your project
2. Your AI assistant already knows your conventions
3. Human tasks are clearly separated in a dashboard
4. One command creates new components with tests
5. Deployment checks prevent common errors
6. You stay in flow, building instead of debugging

This is the Flow State Dev experience.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Create your first FSD project structure
mkdir my-project && cd my-project

# 2. Add the Flow State Dev foundation
curl -O https://flowstatedev.au/quickstart.sh
bash quickstart.sh

# 3. Start building in flow state
code .
```
