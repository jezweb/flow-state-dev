# Claude Code Setup - Practical Roadmap

## 🎯 The Big Picture (Don't worry about all of this now!)
Transform how you and Claude Code work together by standardizing your development workflow.

## 📍 Where You Are Now
- You have a good `user-memory.md` file
- You know about `claude.md` for projects
- You're interested in GitHub issues for task tracking
- You want to reduce friction and errors

## 🚀 Phase 1: Start Simple (Week 1)
**Goal**: Get immediate value with minimal effort

### Step 1: GitHub Labels (Day 1 - 15 minutes)
Create a simple text file with your standard labels:

```bash
# my-labels.txt
bug,B60205,Something isn't working
enhancement,0E8A16,New feature
human-task,FBCA04,Needs human action
frontend,0052CC,Frontend work
backend,0052CC,Backend work
priority:high,B60205,Urgent
priority:low,0E8A16,Can wait
```

**Why start here?** 
- Takes 15 minutes
- Immediately useful
- You'll use these on every project

### Step 2: Basic Claude.md Template (Day 2 - 30 minutes)
Create ONE template for your Vue/Supabase projects:

```markdown
# Project: [NAME]

## Quick Start
1. npm install
2. Copy .env.example to .env
3. npm run dev

## Tech Stack
- Vue 3 + Vuetify 3
- Supabase
- Deployed on Netlify

## Where Things Live
- Components: /src/components
- API calls: /src/services
- Supabase queries: /src/services/supabase.js

## Current Status
Working on: [FEATURE]
Blocked by: [NOTHING/THING]

## Important Notes
- Always check Supabase RLS on new tables
- Remove console.logs before committing
```

**Why this?**
- Claude Code immediately knows your structure
- You can copy-paste for new projects
- Add to it as you learn what's needed

### Step 3: One GitHub Issue Template (Day 3 - 20 minutes)
Just create ONE template that you'll actually use:

```yaml
# .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.yml
name: Development Task
description: Standard task template
labels: ["enhancement"]
body:
  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: What needs to be done?
  - type: checkboxes
    attributes:
      label: Task type
      options:
        - label: Needs human action
        - label: Frontend work
        - label: Backend work
        - label: High priority
```

## 📈 Phase 2: Build Habits (Week 2-4)
**Goal**: Use Phase 1 items until they're natural

### What to Focus On:
1. **Use the labels** on every issue
2. **Update claude.md** when you learn something new
3. **Create issues** for human tasks (API keys, deployments, etc.)

### One New Thing to Try:
Create a "Human Tasks" view in GitHub:
- Go to your repo → Issues → Labels → "human-task"
- Bookmark this URL
- Check it each morning

---

## 🔧 Phase 3: Add Automation (Month 2)
**Goal**: Automate only what's annoying you

### Option A: If you're drowning in issues
Add the **Human Task Dashboard** automation:
- Generates a weekly summary
- Shows what's blocking progress
- Takes 30 min to set up

### Option B: If you keep forgetting project setup
Create a **simple setup script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Just the basics
mkdir src src/components src/services
cp ~/templates/claude.md .
echo "Created basic structure!"
```

### Option C: If you're making the same mistakes
Add **pre-commit hooks**:
- Check for console.logs
- Run basic tests
- Verify .env exists

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: Standardize Your Stack (Month 3)
**Goal**: Create YOUR standard way of building

### Pick ONE thing to standardize:
1. **Error handling pattern** (how you show errors to users)
2. **API calling pattern** (how you fetch data)
3. **Component structure** (how you organize components)

### Document it in a template file:
```javascript
// templates/useApi.js
// This is MY standard way to call APIs
export const useApi = () => {
  // Your pattern here
}
```

---

## 🎯 Phase 5: Build Your Toolkit (Month 4-6)
**Goal**: Gradually build tools that save YOU time

### The Priority Order:
1. **Project starter** - If you make lots of new projects
2. **Component generator** - If you make lots of components
3. **Deployment checker** - If deployments often break
4. **Documentation generator** - If you forget to document

## ✅ Your Action Items This Week

### Day 1 (Today):
1. Create `my-labels.txt` with your GitHub labels (15 min)
2. Save it somewhere you won't lose it

### Day 2:
1. Create a basic `claude.md` template (30 min)
2. Put it in `~/templates/claude.md`

### Day 3:
1. Add the labels to ONE project
2. Create 3 issues using your new labels

### End of Week:
- Reflect: What worked? What was annoying?
- Pick ONE thing from Phase 2 to try next

## 🎪 Remember:
- **Start small** - Even GitHub labels alone will help
- **Build habits** - Use what you build
- **Add gradually** - Only add tools when you feel the pain
- **It's YOUR system** - Customize for your workflow

## 📊 Success Metrics:
You'll know it's working when:
- Claude Code stops asking "how should I structure this?"
- You stop hitting the same problems repeatedly  
- New projects feel faster to start
- You spend less time on setup, more time building

---

## Need Help?
When you're ready for the next phase, just ask:
- "I'm ready for Phase 2"
- "Help me create the setup script"
- "I keep having X problem, what tool would help?"

The goal is to make YOUR development life easier, one small improvement at a time!
