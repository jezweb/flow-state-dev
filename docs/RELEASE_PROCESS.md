## Overview

Flow State Dev uses automated scripts to streamline the release process. The entire process can be completed in under 5 minutes with proper preparation.

### Release Types

- **Patch Release** (0.8.0 ‚Üí 0.8.1): Bug fixes, documentation updates
- **Minor Release** (0.8.0 ‚Üí 0.9.0): New features, backwards compatible
- **Major Release** (0.8.0 ‚Üí 1.0.0): Breaking changes

## Quick Release

For experienced maintainers, here's the streamlined process:

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on main branch with latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Run release script (patch/minor/major)
npm run release:minor

# 3. Validate and publish
npm run release:publish
```

## Detailed Process

### 1. Pre-release Preparation

#### Update Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with new features
- [ ] Add/update examples in docs/
- [ ] Update CLI help text if commands changed

#### Update CHANGELOG
- [ ] Add all changes under `## [Unreleased]` section
- [ ] Use conventional commit format
- [ ] Group by: Added, Fixed, Changed, Removed, Security

Example:
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New `fsd analyze` command for code analysis
- Support for TypeScript projects
- Auto-detection of package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm)

### Fixed
- Memory leak in watch mode
- Incorrect path resolution on Windows

### Changed
- Improved error messages for missing dependencies
- Updated minimum Node.js version to 18
```

### 2. Create Release

#### Choose Version Type
```bash
# Bug fixes only
npm run release:patch

# New features (backwards compatible)
npm run release:minor

# Breaking changes
npm run release:major
```

The release script will:
- ‚úÖ Update version in package.json
- ‚úÖ Update version in bin/fsd.js
- ‚úÖ Convert [Unreleased] to versioned section in CHANGELOG
- ‚úÖ Create git commit and tag
- ‚úÖ Show next steps

### 3. Validation

Run comprehensive validation:
```bash
npm run release:validate
```

This checks:
- Version consistency across files
- Git working directory status
- Dependencies and security
- Test suite passes
- Documentation is updated
- Package size is reasonable

### 4. Publish

```bash
npm run release:publish
```

This will:
1. Verify you're on the main branch
2. Push commits and tags to GitHub
3. Run final validation
4. Publish to npm registry
5. Provide post-publish checklist

### 5. Create GitHub Release

After npm publish succeeds:

1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jezweb/flow-state-dev/releases/new)
2. Select the new tag (e.g., v0.9.0)
3. Set release title: "v0.9.0 - [Feature Name]"
4. Copy changelog section for release notes
5. Add migration guide if breaking changes
6. Publish release (not draft)

### 6. Post-release Tasks

- [ ] Verify npm package: `npm view flow-state-dev`
- [ ] Test installation: `npx flow-state-dev@latest init test-project`
- [ ] Update project roadmap/milestones
- [ ] Announce release (see [Communication](#communication))

## Release Scripts

### `npm run release:patch`
Bumps version from 0.8.0 ‚Üí 0.8.1

### `npm run release:minor`
Bumps version from 0.8.0 ‚Üí 0.9.0

### `npm run release:major`
Bumps version from 0.8.0 ‚Üí 1.0.0

### `npm run release:validate`

### `npm run release:publish`
Interactive publish process with safety checks

### Manual Changelog Generation
```bash
# Preview changelog for next version
node scripts/generate-changelog.js

# Generate and update CHANGELOG.md
node scripts/generate-changelog.js 0.9.0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Version Mismatch Error
If versions don't match across files:
```bash
# Manually fix version in bin/fsd.js
# Then commit the fix
git add bin/fsd.js
git commit -m "fix: sync version numbers"
```

### Failed npm Publish
Common issues:

1. **Not logged in**
   ```bash
   npm login
   npm whoami  # Verify login
   ```

2. **Version already exists**
   - Check npm: `npm view flow-state-dev versions`
   - Bump version again if needed

3. **Network issues**
   - Try: `npm publish --registry https://registry.npmjs.org/`

### Git Push Failed
```bash
# If tags already exist remotely
git push origin main --force-with-lease
git push origin --tags --force
```

## Rollback Procedures

If a release has critical issues:

### 1. Unpublish from npm (within 72 hours)
```bash
# Deprecate instead of unpublish
npm deprecate flow-state-dev@0.9.0 "Critical bug, use 0.9.1"
```

### 2. Git Rollback
```bash
# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.9.0

# Delete local tag
git tag -d v0.9.0

# Revert commits
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

### 3. Release Patch Fix
```bash
# Fix the issue
# Then release patch
npm run release:patch
npm run release:publish
```
