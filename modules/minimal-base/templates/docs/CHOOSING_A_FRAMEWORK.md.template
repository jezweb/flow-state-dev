# Choosing a Frontend Framework

Welcome to {{projectName}}! You've started with a minimal setup, which gives you time to explore and choose the right framework for your project. This guide will help you make an informed decision.

## Available Frameworks

### Vue.js 3
**Best for:** Gradual adoption, template-based syntax, excellent documentation

#### Pros:
- Gentle learning curve
- Excellent documentation and community
- Flexible - can be used for simple or complex apps
- Great TypeScript support
- Powerful template syntax
- Built-in reactivity system

#### Cons:
- Smaller ecosystem than React
- Fewer job opportunities compared to React
- Some concepts (like reactivity) are Vue-specific

#### When to choose Vue:
- You're new to frontend frameworks
- You prefer template-based syntax
- You want a progressive framework (can adopt gradually)
- You value simplicity and developer experience

### React
**Best for:** Large applications, maximum ecosystem, job opportunities

#### Pros:
- Largest ecosystem and community
- Most job opportunities
- Excellent for large-scale applications
- Great TypeScript support
- Can be used for web and mobile (React Native)
- Huge selection of component libraries

#### Cons:
- Steeper learning curve
- More boilerplate code
- Need to choose many additional libraries
- JSX syntax can be confusing initially

#### When to choose React:
- You want maximum ecosystem and library choices
- You're building a large-scale application
- You want to maximize job opportunities
- You might need mobile development later

### Svelte/SvelteKit
**Best for:** Performance-critical apps, minimal bundle size

#### Pros:
- No virtual DOM - compiles to vanilla JS
- Excellent performance
- Very small bundle sizes
- Simple, intuitive syntax
- Built-in state management
- Great developer experience

#### Cons:
- Smaller ecosystem
- Fewer learning resources
- Less mature than Vue/React
- Fewer job opportunities

#### When to choose Svelte:
- Performance is critical
- You want minimal bundle size
- You prefer compile-time optimizations
- You like trying newer technologies

## Making Your Decision

### Consider these factors:

1. **Your Experience Level**
   - Beginner: Vue or Svelte
   - Intermediate/Advanced: Any framework

2. **Project Requirements**
   - Small/Medium project: Any framework
   - Large enterprise: React or Vue
   - Performance critical: Svelte

3. **Team Considerations**
   - Existing team skills
   - Hiring availability in your area
   - Long-term maintenance

4. **Ecosystem Needs**
   - Need lots of pre-built components: React
   - Want official solutions: Vue
   - Prefer minimal dependencies: Svelte

## How to Add Your Chosen Framework

Once you've decided, adding a framework is easy:

```bash
# Add Vue.js with Vuetify UI
fsd upgrade --add-framework vue-vuetify

# Add React (coming soon)
fsd upgrade --add-framework react-mui

# Add SvelteKit (coming soon)
fsd upgrade --add-framework sveltekit
```

## Still Unsure?

That's okay! Here are some suggestions:

1. **Try the tutorials** - Spend 30 minutes with each framework's tutorial
2. **Build a small component** - Try building the same simple component in each
3. **Check job market** - Look at job postings in your area
4. **Ask the community** - Join Discord/Reddit communities and ask questions
