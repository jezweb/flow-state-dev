node -e "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jezweb/flow-state-dev/main/debug/diagnose.js)"

# Or download and run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jezweb/flow-state-dev/main/debug/diagnose.js
node diagnose.js
```

**What it checks**:
- Deep package analysis

# Or download and run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jezweb/flow-state-dev/main/debug/test-install.sh
chmod +x test-install.sh
./test-install.sh
```

**What it does**:
- Clean uninstall of existing installation

# Or download and run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jezweb/flow-state-dev/main/debug/fix-install.sh
chmod +x fix-install.sh
./fix-install.sh
```

**What it fixes**:
- Cleans npm cache and reinstalls
- Fixes file permissions
- Updates PATH configuration
- Tests and verifies fixes

## üéØ When to Use Which Tool

### üîç **Start with `diagnose.sh`**
- First step for any installation issue
- Quick overview of system state
- Identifies most common problems
- Provides specific fix recommendations

### üß™ **Use `test-install.sh` for persistent issues**
- When diagnosis shows problems but cause is unclear
- To test installation process step-by-step
- Generates detailed logs for troubleshooting

### üîß **Try `fix-install.sh` for automated repairs**
- When you want to attempt automatic fixes
- After diagnosis identifies specific issues
- For common PATH and permission problems

### üíª **Use `diagnose.js` for deep analysis**
- When shell scripts don't provide enough detail
- For package and dependency analysis
- When you need Node.js-specific information

## üìã Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Command 'fsd' not found"

**Likely causes**:
1. npm bin directory not in PATH
2. Binary file not created during installation
3. Binary file not executable
4. npm configuration issues

**Diagnosis**: Run `diagnose.sh`  
**Fix**: Run `fix-install.sh`

### Issue: "Package installed but command doesn't work"

**Likely causes**:
1. PATH configuration issue
2. Permission problems
3. Corrupted installation

**Diagnosis**: Run `diagnose.js` for detailed analysis  
**Fix**: Run `test-install.sh` to reinstall cleanly

### Issue: "Permission denied" during installation

**Likely causes**:
1. Need sudo for global npm installs
2. npm prefix misconfigured
3. File system permissions

**Diagnosis**: Check npm configuration  
**Fix**: Configure npm to use user directory or use sudo

## üÜò Getting Help

If none of the diagnostic tools solve your issue:

1. **Run the diagnostic** first:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jezweb/flow-state-dev/main/debug/diagnose.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Create a GitHub issue** with:
   - The complete output from the diagnostic
   - Your operating system and Node.js version
   - Steps you've already tried

3. **Include relevant logs**:
   - Installation logs from `test-install.sh`
   - Any error messages
   - Output from manual installation attempts
