## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Enhancements
- **Error Boundaries**: Global and component-level error handling
- **State Management**: Improved loading and error states
- **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, caching
- **Testing**: Unit tests, E2E tests, performance monitoring
- **Real API**: Full CLI integration with real-time updates

### Quality Assurance
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals optimization
- **Security**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling
- **Usability**: Professional UX patterns

## Sprint Planning

### Sprint 1: Error Handling & UX Polish
**Duration**: 1 week
**Focus**: Immediate user experience improvements
- Error boundaries and handling
- Loading states and feedback
- Form validation
- Keyboard navigation

### Sprint 2: Performance & Testing
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks  
**Focus**: Optimization and quality assurance
- Code splitting and performance
- Test infrastructure and coverage
- Monitoring and measurement

### Sprint 3: Real API Integration
**Duration**: 1 week
**Focus**: Production functionality
- Real API validation
- CLI integration testing
- Production readiness

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **API Integration Complexity**: Mitigated by comprehensive testing
- **Performance Impact**: Addressed through code splitting and optimization
- **Browser Compatibility**: Covered by E2E testing suite
- **State Management**: Resolved through improved error boundaries

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Mitigated by clear feature boundaries
